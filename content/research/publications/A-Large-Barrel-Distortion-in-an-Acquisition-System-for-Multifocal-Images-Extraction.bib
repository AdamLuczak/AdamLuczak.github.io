abstract="This paper presents a new way to use the well-known distortions introduced by the fisheye lens (ultra-wide-angle lenses) and a well-known algorithms for the correction of distortion in order to obtain completely new functionality in supervision and monitoring of video. The suggested way to use the barrel distortion will result in a smoother zooming and allows to achieve the multiple images simultaneously with the same resolution but with a different viewing angle. This feature may vary greatly increase the effectiveness of surveillance application by providing a greater amount of visual data from one camera.",
