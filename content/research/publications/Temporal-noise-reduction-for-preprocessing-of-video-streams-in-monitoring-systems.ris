N2  - This paper presents an efficient preprocessing algorithm for dealing with noise in video sequences. The algo-rithm is based on simple thresholding and linear filtering. First stage of proposed technique is motion detection which separates steady regions from moving ones. Second stage involves tempo-ral filtering of steady regions. That yields with "freezed" blocks that are more susceptible for compression. The proposed algo-rithm is appropriate for preprocessing stage before compres-sion of video sequences.
