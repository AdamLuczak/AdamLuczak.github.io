  abstract={The paper presents a new and efficient architecture for H.264/AVC video encoder control. The architecture of mode decision and cost estimation module is implemented with the use of bit-serial arithmetic and provides pipelined processing of image blocks. The module is designed to support FPGA devices. It has been shown that the design is capable to perform at a very low clock speed, thus it is a suitable solution for wireless communications. The proposed modules have been implemented in Verilog HDL and synthesized for a Xilinx Virtex II family device},
